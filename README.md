## üéØ Career Counselling

As part of the Work Readiness Training, I participated in a series of career counselling activities hosted through the CPUT Student Counselling platform. The programme emphasized the importance of mental well-being with resources like *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK not to be OK‚Äù*, and included a comprehensive module titled **"Career Counselling and Assessment"**.

My task was to actively engage with the student counselling resources, complete the modules, and reflect on how I could apply the skills and insights to my personal career journey.

**A ‚Äì Action:**  
I attended the sessions available through the online platform and carefully reviewed materials such as "Career Planning in a Changing Context", the "5 Skills and Traits to Succeed" video, and "5 Ways to Stand Out in a Virtual Interview". I also made notes, participated in discussions where applicable, and reflected on how these topics applied to me as an aspiring software developer.

**R ‚Äì Result:**  
As a result of this experience, I now feel more confident in my career direction and better prepared to market myself effectively. I understand the importance of self-awareness, adaptability, and emotional intelligence in the workplace.

**Lehlogonolo Gledwin Mahlangu**

The **Personality Assessment** was one of the most eye-opening components of my self-development journey. Understanding how personality traits align with specific career paths allowed me to think critically about where I fit best in the professional world. This module didn't just test knowledge‚Äîit offered a mirror into who I am and how that translates into the workplace.

### Why It Mattered

Personality plays a foundational role in job satisfaction, productivity, and long-term career success. Through this assessment, I recognized tendencies that influence my behavior, preferences for work environments, and how I interact in teams or leadership roles. I now have a clearer picture of how I can align my natural inclinations with career opportunities that will allow me to thrive.

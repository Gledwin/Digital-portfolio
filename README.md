## üéØ Career Counselling

### üìÅ Evidence

As part of the Work Readiness Training, I participated in a series of career counselling activities hosted through the CPUT Student Counselling platform. The programme emphasized the importance of mental well-being with resources like *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK not to be OK‚Äù*, and included a comprehensive module titled **"Career Counselling and Assessment"**.

In addition, I engaged with several learning materials under the **"Build Your Career"** section. These included:
- Career Planning in a Changing Context
- 5 Skills and Traits You Will Need to Succeed in the Workplace
- 5 Ways to Stand Out in a Virtual Interview
- How to Excel at Your First Job
- How to Prepare for Your First Corporate Job
- Conflict Resolution in the Workplace

These resources provided me with practical knowledge and strategies for navigating interviews, building a professional profile, and preparing for success in the workplace.

### ‚ú® Reflection (STAR Technique)

**S ‚Äì Situation:**  
At the beginning of the career counselling programme, I felt uncertain about how to approach my transition from student life to the working world. I had limited understanding of what employers look for and how to present myself confidently during job applications and interviews.

**T ‚Äì Task:**  
My task was to actively engage with the student counselling resources, complete the modules, and reflect on how I could apply the skills and insights to my personal career journey.

**A ‚Äì Action:**  
I attended the sessions available through the online platform and carefully reviewed materials such as "Career Planning in a Changing Context", the "5 Skills and Traits to Succeed" video, and "5 Ways to Stand Out in a Virtual Interview". I also made notes, participated in discussions where applicable, and reflected on how these topics applied to me as an aspiring software developer.

**R ‚Äì Result:**  
As a result of this experience, I now feel more confident in my career direction and better prepared to market myself effectively. I understand the importance of self-awareness, adaptability, and emotional intelligence in the workplace. I also developed a clearer career vision, with realistic expectations and strategies to achieve my goals.
